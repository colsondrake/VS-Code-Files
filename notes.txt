CSCI 2720 Programming Assignment 4

Fall 2024

General Requirements: 
* implementing: selection sort, merge sort, heap sort, and quick sort
* writing a report analyzing the functions
    * note: for quick sort, two unique implementations are to be written: one uses the last element of the array as the pivot, the other should use a random element of the array as the pivot
* ALL functions need to keep track of the NUMBER OF COMPARISONS used by the sorting algorithm
* each sorting algorithm should sort an array of integers into ASCENDING order

Additional Requirements: 
* no need for generics or an 'ItemType' class
* ***AT LEAST TWO sorting algorithms need to be written RECURSIVELY
* program should TERMINATE after the sorting is done 
* RECOMMENDATION: create a 'Sorting.java' class with all the sorting algorithms as methods, use an integer array to store the input, and pass this integer array to these methods
* driver will take which sorting algorithm to be used as input
* use type LONG to count comparisons
*
